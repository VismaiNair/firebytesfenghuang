            <h2>Why should you make your code public?</h2>
            <p>There are many reasons why one should make their code public. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Making code available allows more people to use it, which is a good thing if you have a permissive open-source license</li>
                <li>It also makes people more comfortable, for if you share the cookie-defining script, they get a good idea of how long it will last and for what purpose it is made. This allows for a higher reputation for you as a developer and for your website as one that holds no secrets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lastly, it can also be a <span class = "highlight">useful tool for advertising</span> as users will attribute your software if your license states that they must. This makes more people view your code, which in turn brings more people to your website. 
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>A counter-argument</h3>
            <p><em>"If<span class = "highlight">people can use the developer tools to view my code on their own, </span>then why should I make my code public?" </em>-A rightly skeptic web developer</p>
            <br>
            <p>We all like our time, and don't want to waste it. This is a fundamental concept of the human brain. However, one developer's actions can have an effect from as little as 0 people to as much as 1,000,000 people and even beyond! It takes time to comb through the developer tools' complex UI, and no one wants to waste their time. If the amount of developers is more than the amount of users, you might not want to add a place to view code more easily. However, if you have more users than developers, as is usually the case for projects on which hours of work are spent, you may want to make code more easily viewable; after all, if a company has 50 developers, and they impact 200 users who want to see the code, 2 minutes of work on your side can save 80 minutes of theirs!</p>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <p>In the end, however, it's your choice: will you make code easily available or not? It's up to you.</p>
