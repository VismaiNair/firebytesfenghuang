            <h1>Firebytes Robotics</h1>
            <p>Firebytes Robotics is an extracurricular club at BASIS Phoenix for 6th, 7th, and 8th graders. The primary intents of the club are to teach students about robotics, coding, and instill collaboration skill by competing in the First Lego League. </p>
            <h2>Firebytes Teams</h2>
            <img src = "images/firebird.jpg" class = "float-right" width = "25%" alt = "The mascot of BASIS Phoenix, the Firebird">
            <p>In alphabetical order, the 5 teams in Firebytes Robotics are:</p>
            <ul>u</li>
                <li>Firebytes Feng Huang
                <li>Firebytes Bennu</li>
                <li>Firebytes Garuda</li>
                <li>Firebytes Huma</li>
                <li>Firebytes Zhar Ptysia</li>

            </ul>
            <p>All Firebytes teams are named after mythical birds because BASIS Phoenix's mascot is the Firebird.</p>
            <h1>Regional Qualifiers</h1>
            <p>Ten members of Firebytes Feng Huang will go to compete at the regional qualification tournament at Arizona State University on December 16. At the competition, our robot, named Feng Huang, will attempt to complete the 2023 FLL Challenges.</p>
            <h1>State Competition</h1>
            <p>If Firebytes Feng Huang  is qualified for the state-level competition, we will attempt to win the state competition by completing the 2023 FLL Challenges using our robot with no real-time control or remote control. However, there is a chance of failure at the regional qualifiers, which will not allow us to compete at the state level.</p>
            <h1>World Competition</h1>
            <img src = "images/earth.png" class = "floar-right" width = "25%" alt = "The world. So many people live on Earth that the chances of victory are very small for Firebytes Feng Huang.">
            <p class = "float-left">The chances of Firebytes Feng Huang winning the state competition and continuing to the world-level competition are very small, for at the state level are, undoubtedly, other teams that have met more often than Firebytes Feng Huang and have had many more weeks of preparation than the members of Firebytes Feng Huang. At the world-level competition, the best of the best compete, and, sadly, Firebytes Feng Huang does not have as much preparation time as such amazing teams. </p>
