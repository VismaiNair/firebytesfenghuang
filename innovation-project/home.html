                <h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
                <p> Written literature is an artistic thing in its own right, yet it is not treated as such. Descriptive writing can paint a picture in people's minds just as well as music and art, yet it is not recognized, especially in the form of wordplay, riddles, and poetry. </p>
                <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
                <p>We're collecting research! <abbr>It's not too late to contribute.</abbr></p>
                <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeMQkFe2kS9C3KhReYHD8asEqFd4qhYtXkO1DYLjkObpR5k-w/viewform?embedded=true" width="700" height="1000" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loadingâ€¦</iframe>
                <p>Research collection will end on December 10, 2023, and research will be published the same day. </p>
                <h2>OUR SOLUTIONS</h2>
                <h3>Poems</h3>
                <p>We believe that poems are one of the most artistic forms of writing, yet they are not appreciated because it is hard to find a collection of decent poems. We've built a generator to randomly pick a poem from a curated database and show it to you.</p>
                <button>USE THE RANDOMIZED GENERATOR</button>
                <h3>Riddles</h3>
                <p>Because riddles are not easily accessible, we've built a short game to introduce people to the beauty of riddles. Ready to Play?</p>

                <h3>Wordplay</h3>
