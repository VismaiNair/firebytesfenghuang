                "highlight">He was the teacher for Firebytes Feng Huang</span>, and has done much to support the team, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learning and teaching us how to code the robot</li>
                <li>Spending hours researching the challenges so that he could guide us</li>
                <li>Informing us of the Innovation Project and guiding discussions about the Innovation Project</li>
                <li>Being a great inspiration to everyone on Firebytes Feng Huang</li>
                <li>Radiating positive energy wherever he went</li>
                <li>Being the most generous teacher at our school</li>

            <p>Mr. Noori was a great inspiration to everyone, and we appreciate his hard work to ensure that Firebytes Feng Huang still has a chance at the competition. It is only because of Mr. Noori that Firebytes Feng Huang RISEs and works together to try and win.</p>

            <p><span class = 
                "highlight">Sadly, Mr. Noori passed away before we had a chance to represent Firebytes Feng Huang at the Regional Qualifiers. He passed away on November 30, 2023, and never had a chance to see the things we built for him, including this page. His students and colleagues mourned his passing</span>, and built a memorial in front of his former classroom. He was truly a great teacher, and, if we win, it is all thanks to the work he put in when he was still with us. However, the future of Firebytes Feng Huang is now uncertain, for our mentor, teacher, and inspiration has now left us. His family informed BASIS Phoenix that he had died, and, out of respect for his greiving family, we will not share the details of his death. He was loved by all, and his generosity will never be forgotten.</p>
